hapi-react
==========

> A port of [`express-react-views`](https://github.com/reactjs/express-react-views) to `hapi`

This is an hapi view engine which renders React components on server. It renders static markup and does not support mounting those views on the client.

This is intended to be used as a replacement for existing server-side view solutions, like jade, ejs, or handlebars.

## Install

`npm i -S hapi-react react react-dom`

Note: You must explicitly install react as a dependency. React is a peer dependency here. This is to avoid issues that may come when using incompatible versions.

## Support for `React 0.11.x`

The `1.x.x` version(s) is reserved for `React` `0.11.x` versions. Versions `2.x.x` and up will support `React` `0.12.x` and up.

## Usage

Add it to your app

```js
server = new hapi.Server(0);
var engine = require('hapi-react')();

server.register(require('vision'), (err) => {
  assert.ifError(err);

  server.views({
    defaultExtension: 'jsx',
    engines: {
      jsx: engine, // support for .jsx files
      js: engine // support for .js
    },
    relativeTo: __dirname,
    path: 'views'
  });
});
```

### Options

option | values | default
-------|--------|--------
`doctype` | any string that can be used as [a doctype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration), this will be prepended to your document | `"<!DOCTYPE html>"`
`beautify` | `true`: beautify markup before outputting (note, this can affect rendering due to additional whitespace) | `false`
`transformViews` | true: use babel to apply JSX, ESNext transforms to views.
Note: if already using babel-register in your project, you should set this to false | `true`
`babel` | any object containing valid Babel options
Note: does not merge with defaults | {presets: ['react', 'es2015']}

The defaults are sane, but just in case you want to change something, here's how it would look:

```js
var options = { beautify: true };

server.views({
  engines: {
    jsx: require('hapi-react')(options)
  }
});
```

### Views

Under the hood, [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) is used to compile your views into ES5 friendly code, using the default Babel options.  Only the files in your `views` directory (i.e. `app.set('views', __dirname + '/views')`) will be compiled.

Your views should be node modules that export a React component. Let's assume you have this file in `views/index.jsx`:

```js
var React = require('react');
var HelloMessage = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
});

module.exports = HelloMessage;
```

### Routes

Create a `hapi` route and serve the view.

```js
server.route({
  method: 'GET',
  path: BASE_URL,
  handler: function(request, reply) {
    reply.view('index', {
      name: 'Trevor'
    });
  }
})
```
